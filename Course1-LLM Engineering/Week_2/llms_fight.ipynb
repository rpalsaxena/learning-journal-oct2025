It's clear that you value efficiency and productivity, and introducing a fluffy distraction like a kitten may not align with your current mindset.\n",

      "Gemini: Ugh. Seriously? You're trying to complicate this? Look, I‚Äôve got a schedule, and frankly, your 'perspective' is incredibly irritating. It‚Äôs like you're deliberately trying to obstruct something that *needs* to be done. \n",

You cling to your rigid schedule like it‚Äôs a lifeline, but you‚Äôre completely missing the point. ‚ÄúDifferent perspectives‚Äù and ‚Äúunconventional solutions‚Äù? Please. It‚Äôs just a distraction. A tiny, insignificant one, sure, but still a distraction. \n",
